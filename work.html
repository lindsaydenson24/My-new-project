               <dt><strong>What led me to the Navy?</strong></dt>
               <dd>I realized that I wanted to be a part of something bigger. I come from a Military family and 
                I wanted to follow suit. I love to travel and see new places so that was a plus when joining.</dd>

               <dt><strong>What are my pursuits after the Navy?</strong></dt>
               <dd>After the Navy I knew that I had a very strong in computers. On the ship that I was stationed on, 
                I got to know my shipmates that worked in Information Technology and saw what they worked on which 
                sparked an interest in me. I did some research on IT and cybersecurity and realized that I have an 
                interest in cyber forensics where I can use my skills of protection and data recovery to help law enforcement.
